# join-subst
JOIN and SUBST external commands for FreeDOS

Recent versions of FreeDOS no longer have dedicated JOIN and SUBST external commands. This causes some software installers to fail, including: 

* Origin Systems’ 1993 Ultima I – VI Series CD compilation
* Ocean Software’s Pushover
* Software Toolworks’ Game Packs

Copy these JOIN and SUBST executables from FreeDOS 1.0 into the /FDOS/BIN/ directory.

These are the versions from FreeDOS 1.0, from 2006, obtained from https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/freedos/files/distributions/1.0/ and they inherit its open source license.
