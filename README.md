# join-subst
JOIN and SUBST external commands for FreeDOS

Recent versions of FreeDOS no longer have dedicated JOIN and SUBST external commands. This causes some software installers to fail, including as Origin Systems’ 1993 Ultima I – VI CD compilation, Ocean Software’s Pushover and Software Toolworks’ Game Packs.

Copy these JOIN and SUBST executables from FreeDOS 1.0 into the /FDOS/BIN/ directory.

These are the versions from FreeDOS 1.0, from 2006, obtained from https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/freedos/files/distributions/1.0/
